# Telegram Display Configuration Bot (Batter Bot)

This Python-based Telegram bot facilitates remote management of PC display configurations through the execution of specific .bat files located in the same directory as the script. It is designed to offer a convenient interface for users to change their display settings via Telegram commands. Originally named Batter Bot after the intended purpose of running `.bat` files. Thus, `.bat`ter Bot!

## Features

- Logging: Comprehensive logging of bot activities, including command usage and execution outcomes, to a file named `bot_activity.log`.
- Environment Variable Management: Utilizes `.env` for secure storage and retrieval of essential configurations like Telegram bot token and allowed user ID.
- Command Handling: Supports several commands for user interaction:
  - `/start` - Initiates interaction with the bot, restricted to an authorized user.
  - `/chatid` - Provides the user with their chat ID.
  - `/runbat` - Lists available .bat files for display configuration and executes them upon user selection.
- Secure Execution of .bat Files: Executes selected `.bat` files safely, handling successes and failures gracefully.

## Setup
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `python-telegram-bot` library
- `python-dotenv library` for environment variable management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```
pip install python-telegram-bot python-dotenv
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_ID=your_telegram_user_id_here
```

4. Replace `your_bot_token_here` and `your_telegram_user_id_here` with your actual Telegram bot token and Telegram user ID, respectively.

### Usage

1. Ensure your `.bat` files are in the same directory as the script. These files should be named in a way that describes their function, e.g., `TvOnly_4k.bat`, `Default_3x_1440p.bat`, `CenterOnly_1440p.bat`. Note: The script is configured to exclude `run_script.bat` from being listed or executed.
2. Start the bot by running the script:

```
python telegram_display_bot.py
```

3. Interact with the bot via the supported commands in a Telegram chat.

## Security

This bot is configured to respond only to commands from a specified Telegram user ID, set through the environment variable `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_ID`. Ensure this ID and access to your Telegram account is kept secure and not shared with unauthorized individuals. Ensure access to the local machine is restricted similarly.

## Logging

Activity logging is enabled by default, with logs stored in `bot_activity.log`. These logs provide insights into bot usage and help with troubleshooting.
